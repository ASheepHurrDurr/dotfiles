This repository contains the dotfiles that I like to use.
## Brightness
This is a utility used to set the brightness of a laptop display. It requires root access to be able to modify the brightness file. This can be done easily by using a sudoers file. The command line options are as follows:

  * -i : Increase screen brightness by 5%
  * -d : Decrease screen brightness by 5%
  * -q : Query the current screen brightness
  * -m : Set the screen brightness to its minimum value (about 5%)
  * -M : Set the screen brightness to its maximum value

Before compiling be sure to check that the paths for the files are correct.
